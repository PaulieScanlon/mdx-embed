# Gist

Display a Gist by including the component in your `.mdx`. The `gistLink` prop is required.

<ArgsTable of={Gist} />

## Usage

<Canvas>
  <Story name="usage">
    <Gist gistLink="PaulieScanlon/ca0cc9239176066492cb2aba435edbf7" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Help

<Story name="help" />

To embed an Gist using the `<Gist />` component grab the `username` and `id` from the Gist URL.

```
https://gist.github.com/PaulieScanlon/ca0cc9239176066492cb2aba435edbf7#file-gatsby-mdx-embed-html
```

The `username` and `id` are these bits.

```
PaulieScanlon/ca0cc9239176066492cb2aba435edbf7
```

Then use it like this.

```jsx
<Gist gistLink="PaulieScanlon/ca0cc9239176066492cb2aba435edbf7" />
```
