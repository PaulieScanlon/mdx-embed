# Figma

Display a Figma file by including the component in your `.mdx`. The `title` and `url` props are required.

<ArgsTable of={Figma} />

## Usage

<Canvas>
  <Story name="usage">
    <Figma title="Boop" url="file/LKQ4FJ4bTnCSjedbRpk931/Sample-File" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Help

<Story name="help" />

To embed a Figma file or frame using the `<Figma />` component choose an appropriate `title` for the embed (which is used as an id on the iframe) and the `url` of the file/frame/prototype.

For example, you will copy the part after `https://www.figma.com/`:

```
https://www.figma.com/file/LKQ4FJ4bTnCSjedbRpk931/Sample-File
```

Then use it like this.

```jsx
<Figma title="Boop" url="file/LKQ4FJ4bTnCSjedbRpk931/Sample-File" />
```

It's important to include the file or proto prefix as this states what type of file should be embedded and it won't work without the correct prefix.
