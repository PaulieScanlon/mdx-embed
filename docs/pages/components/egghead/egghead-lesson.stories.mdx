## Help

<Story name="help" />

To embed an Egghead video using the `<EggheadLesson />` component grab the `lessonId` from the URL.

It should be everything after `https://egghead.io/lessons/` pay attention to the url for `?pl=` this will show if the lesson relates to a playlist, you will need to remove the playlist query.

```
https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-gatsby-site-to-use-mdx-with-gatsby-plugin-mdx-with-a-default-layout?pl=using-components-in-markdown-with-mdx-5de0
```

The `lessonId` is this bit.

```
gatsby-set-up-a-gatsby-site-to-use-mdx-with-gatsby-plugin-mdx-with-a-default-layout
```

Then use it like this.

```jsx
<EggheadLesson lessonId="gatsby-set-up-a-gatsby-site-to-use-mdx-with-gatsby-plugin-mdx-with-a-default-layout" />
```
