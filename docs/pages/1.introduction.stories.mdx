MDX Embed allows you to easily _embed_ popular 3rd party media content such as YouTube videos, Tweets, Instagram posts, Egghead lessons, Spotify, TikTok and many more straight into your `.mdx` - **no import required!**

There are a couple of ways to use MDX Embed so you may wish to explore each of the packages:

- [mdx-embed](/?path=/story/mdx-embed--page)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed](/?path=/story/gatsby-plugin--page)
- [storybook-addon-mdx-embed](/?path=/story/storybook-addon--page)

## How it works

Once MDX Embed is correctly installed you can write as you normally would in MDX and to include an embed you can pop it in your MDX like this ðŸ‘‡

```js
// some-mdx-file.mdx
#### My cool pen

Here's a pen, and some other blog post text

<CodePen codePenId="PNaGbb" />
```

## _Which renders as ðŸ‘‡_
