MDX Embed allows you to easily _embed_ popular 3rd party media content such as YouTube videos, Tweets, Instagram posts, Egghead lessons, Spotify, TikTok and many more straight into your `.mdx` - **no import required!**

There are a couple of ways to use MDX Embed so you may wish to explore each of the packages:

- [mdx-embed](/?path=/story/mdx-embed--page)
- [gatsby-plugin-mdx-embed](/?path=/story/gatsby-plugin--page)
- [storybook-addon-mdx-embed](/?path=/story/storybook-addon--page)

<Box sx={{ height: '24px' }} />

## How it works

Once MDX Embed is correctly installed you can write as you normally would in MDX and to include an embed you can pop it in your MDX like this ðŸ‘‡

```js
// some-mdx-file.mdx
#### My cool pen

Here's a pen, and some other blog post text

<CodePen codePenId="PNaGbb" />
```

## _Which renders as ðŸ‘‡_

<Box sx={{ height: '24px' }} />

<PayWithStripe />

    text={`"As an MDX power user I was looking for a great way to enable social embeds on my site without having to roll each one myself. mdx-embed was perfect, it was easy to get up and running and provided exactly what I was looking for."`}
